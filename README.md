# demo-pttbbs
This is the demo of web-based pttbbs using openbbs-middleware.

# Getting Started

## Starting server at localhost

``` sh
npm start
```

Then you should be able to access the page on localhost:3000.

# Development

## For building multiple html pages

Besides the home-page, we would like to have
several complete-independent pages,
including register, forgot-password, admin, etc.
